# Reupload

HFS plugin to download a file, so that you can modify it locally, and it will upload it back automatically, modified, as soon is it sees changes.

This means that you can modify any type of file, provided that you have necessary software on your computer.

If everything is correct, you will see the new command appear in the file menu, like this:

If the page is closed or reloaded, the file will stop being monitored. You can still navigate folders freely.

[**WARNING: this works only with Chrome and https**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/showSaveFilePicker#browser_compatibility)

Install it from Admin-panel > Plugins > Search online .

You need upload permission and disable "don't overwrite uploading" option. As an alternative to disabling the option, you can give delete permission.
