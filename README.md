# Reupload
HFS plugin to re-upload a downloaded file if changes are detected.

**WARNING: this works only with Chrome and https** 

Install it from Admin-panel > Plugins > Search online .

You need upload permission and disable "don't overwrite uploading" option. As an alternative to disabling the option, you can give delete permission.

If everything is correct, you will see the new command appear in the file menu, like this:
